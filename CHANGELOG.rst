Initial Release
===============

2022-01-29
----------

Proper packaging with description and testing, leveraging own test and build
infrastructure with (buildbot)[https://build.pramari.de/].
For the time being, only functionality included is to get secrets from
Google Cloud Platforms Secret Manager with `getSecret`, but plan to include
further functions that power multiple projects and come handy for hosting and
operating python projects in cloud environments.
